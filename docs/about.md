# About This Learning Journey

## 👋 Hello!

I'm documenting my 6-month journey to master Machine Learning, CUDA programming, and Large Language Model engineering. This project serves two purposes:

1. **Personal accountability** - Track my daily progress and learnings
2. **Validate AI-suggested roadmaps** - Prove that structured learning paths work

## 🎯 The Challenge: Unsloth-Level Skills in 6 Months

**180 days** of intensive learning to reach production-level ML/CUDA engineering skills:

### Month 1: Foundations (Days 1-30)
Master Python, NumPy, linear algebra, calculus, probability, PyTorch tensors, and autograd.

### Month 2: Core ML/DL (Days 31-60)
Build and train CNNs and RNNs. Implement backpropagation by hand. Deep dive into optimizers.

### Month 3: CUDA + C++ (Days 61-90)
Learn CUDA fundamentals (threads, blocks, shared memory). Write custom kernels in C++ and Triton.

### Month 4: Transformers + LLMs (Days 91-120)
Implement attention mechanisms, positional encodings, and build a Transformer from scratch.

### Month 5: Systems + Optimization (Days 121-150)
Multi-GPU training (DDP, FSDP), quantization techniques (QLoRA), profiling, and memory optimization.

### Month 6: Production & Research (Days 151-180)
Contribute to open-source projects (Unsloth, TRL, vLLM). Run fine-tuning pipelines on rented GPUs.

**Target**: Build skills to contribute meaningfully to cutting-edge LLM optimization frameworks

## 📚 Learning Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
- **Daily consistency** over intensity
- **Build foundations** before advanced topics
- **Code everything** - no passive learning
- **Document insights** - teach to learn better
- **Embrace struggle** - difficulty means growth

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python 3.9+, CUDA C/C++
- **Frameworks**: NumPy, PyTorch, Triton
- **Tools**: Jupyter, Google Colab (GPU), VS Code
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## 📖 Content Structure

Each day includes:
- **Task file** (`task.md`) - Objectives and goals
- **Code exercises** - Hands-on implementation
- **Learning log** - Blog post with insights and reflections
- **Progress tracking** - Updated completion status

## 🌟 Why Public?

Sharing this journey publicly because:
- **Accountability** - Public commitment drives consistency
- **Help others** - Provide a tested roadmap for aspiring ML engineers
- **Community** - Learn from feedback and discussions
- **Transparency** - Show the real ups and downs of learning
