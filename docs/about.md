# About This Learning Journey

## 👋 Hello!

I'm documenting my 6-month journey to master Machine Learning, CUDA programming, and Large Language Model engineering. This project serves two purposes:

1. **Personal accountability** - Track my daily progress and learnings
2. **Validate AI-suggested roadmaps** - Prove that structured learning paths work

## 🎯 The Challenge

**180 days** of focused learning covering:
- Python numerical computing (NumPy, linear algebra)
- Deep learning fundamentals (neural networks, backpropagation)
- GPU programming (CUDA C/C++, memory optimization)
- Large Language Models (Transformers, attention mechanisms)
- Advanced topics (model optimization, deployment)

## 📚 Learning Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
- **Daily consistency** over intensity
- **Build foundations** before advanced topics
- **Code everything** - no passive learning
- **Document insights** - teach to learn better
- **Embrace struggle** - difficulty means growth

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python 3.9+, CUDA C/C++
- **Frameworks**: NumPy, PyTorch, Triton
- **Tools**: Jupyter, Google Colab (GPU), VS Code
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## 📖 Content Structure

Each day includes:
- **Task file** (`task.md`) - Objectives and goals
- **Code exercises** - Hands-on implementation
- **Learning log** - Blog post with insights and reflections
- **Progress tracking** - Updated completion status

## 🌟 Why Public?

Sharing this journey publicly because:
- **Accountability** - Public commitment drives consistency
- **Help others** - Provide a tested roadmap for aspiring ML engineers
- **Community** - Learn from feedback and discussions
- **Transparency** - Show the real ups and downs of learning
