# 🚀 Welcome to My ML/CUDA/LLM Learning Journey

I'm embarking on a **180-day intensive learning track** to master Machine Learning, CUDA programming, and Large Language Model engineering. This site documents every step of the journey.

## 🎯 Mission

**Dual Purpose:**
1. **Personal Mastery**: Track my journey from foundations to advanced ML/CUDA/LLM engineering
2. **Validate AI-Suggested Roadmaps**: Prove that AI-generated learning paths are practical and achievable

## 📊 Current Status

- **Day**: 1 / 180
- **Progress**: 0.6%
- **Current Focus**: Environment setup & NumPy fundamentals
- **Streak**: 1 day 🔥

## 🎓 6-Month Master Plan (Toward Unsloth-Level Skill)

| Month | Focus | Key Goals |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **1** (Days 1-30) | **Foundations** | Master Python, NumPy, linear algebra, calculus, probability, PyTorch tensors, autograd |
| **2** (Days 31-60) | **Core ML/DL** | Build and train CNNs, RNNs; implement backprop by hand; understand optimizers |
| **3** (Days 61-90) | **CUDA + C++** | Learn CUDA fundamentals (threads, blocks, shared memory); write kernels in C++/Triton |
| **4** (Days 91-120) | **Transformers + LLMs** | Implement attention, positional encodings, and tiny Transformer from scratch |
| **5** (Days 121-150) | **Systems + Optimization** | Multi-GPU (DDP, FSDP), quantization (QLoRA), profiling, memory optimization |
| **6** (Days 151-180) | **Production & Research** | Contribute to open-source (Unsloth, TRL, vLLM); run fine-tuning pipelines on rented GPUs |

**Goal**: Build skills to contribute to cutting-edge LLM optimization projects like [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth)
