# 🚀 Welcome to My ML/CUDA/LLM Learning Journey

I'm embarking on a **180-day intensive learning track** to master Machine Learning, CUDA programming, and Large Language Model engineering. This site documents every step of the journey.

## 🎯 Mission

**Dual Purpose:**
1. **Personal Mastery**: Track my journey from foundations to advanced ML/CUDA/LLM engineering
2. **Validate AI-Suggested Roadmaps**: Prove that AI-generated learning paths are practical and achievable

## 📊 Current Status

- **Day**: 1 / 180
- **Progress**: 0.6%
- **Current Focus**: Environment setup & NumPy fundamentals
- **Streak**: 1 day 🔥

## 🎓 Learning Tracks

This roadmap covers:
- ✅ **Foundations**: NumPy, linear algebra, calculus review (Days 1-30)
- 🔄 **Deep Learning**: Neural networks, backpropagation, optimization (Days 31-60)
- ⏳ **CUDA Programming**: GPU kernels, memory optimization (Days 61-90)
- ⏳ **LLM Engineering**: Transformers, attention mechanisms (Days 91-150)
- ⏳ **Advanced Topics**: Model optimization, deployment (Days 151-180)
