## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Week 1: Environment & Python Fundamentals (Days 1-7)

#### Day 1: Prepare, Orient, and Build Core Tools ✅
- [x] Install local tools (Homebrew, Python, VS Code, Git)
- [x] Create virtual environment and install packages (NumPy, matplotlib, Jupyter)
- [x] Practice NumPy basics: arrays, matrices, transpose, dot products
- [x] Solve linear algebra problems (Ax=b, matrix inversion)
- [x] Verify Google Colab GPU access
- [x] Create Jupyter notebook with learning notes
- [x] Document understanding of: matrices, transpose, homogeneous arrays, type promotion

**Key Learnings:**
- Understanding scalar, vector, tensor, and dimensions
- NumPy type hierarchy: `bool < int < float < complex < str`
- Homogeneous arrays enable fast mathematical operations
- Foundation for future CUDA parallel computing

#### Day 2: [Coming soon]
- [ ] Deep dive into linear algebra
- [ ] Vectors, matrix multiplication, basis, rank
- [ ] Start preparing for PyTorch tensor fundamentals
