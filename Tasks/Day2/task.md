# Core Linear Algebra for ML + NumPy Deep Dive

Objective:  
Build strong intuition for **linear algebra operations** (vectors, matrics, dot products, projections) and connect them to **NumPy implementations**.
These are the mathematical foundations for **PyTorch, neural networks, CUDA kernels** and **Transformers**.

1. Watch: "How GPUs works**
This builds your mental model for why GPUs are essential for ML.

(Obsoluted instead IBM's GPU youtube.)

2. Read: NumPy Quickstart (10–15 min)

You’ll reinforce matrix operations and shapes.

3. Study Linear Algebra Essentials (20–30 min)

Focus only on these concepts today:

Scalars, vectors, matrices, tensors

Matrix multiplication rules

Dot product

Transpose

Identity matrix

Norms (L1, L2)
